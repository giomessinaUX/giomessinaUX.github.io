            I've spent the last two and a half years at Siemens as a User Experience Designer and Researcher, focusing on smart cities and sustainability. <br><br>

            After my first experience at the startup Cubbit, I've been a consultant for seven wonderful years now!<br><br>

            To download my resume, just click here.<br><br>

            I've also put together a quick table with the most significant projects I've been involved in recently.<br><br>

            The ever-changing client and project landscape has allowed me to keep a highly adaptive approach and learn some valuable lessons along the way.<br><br>
