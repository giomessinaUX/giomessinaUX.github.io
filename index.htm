            <p>
                I like bullet points listings, bar charts, actual and future rituals and floating stuff in general.
                I try not to use <i>beautiful</i> and <i>ugly</i> as adjectives, as I find those limitating, and I usually start my sentences with the<i> in my opinion</i> formula.</p><p>
                    I particularly enjoy working on topics that have an impact.
