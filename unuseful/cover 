Dear grape Team,
I am writing to express my interest in the Product Designer role at grape. With over nine years of experience shaping complex, data-rich enterprise products across both startups and large organizations, I have gained expertise across the full spectrum of the digital product design process. 

Before anything else, allow me to link my personal website, where you can find my portfolio. The URL is giomessina.com.

Your mission to revolutionize employee insurance through innovation and technology-driven transformation aligns with my passion for creating products that deliver meaningful, real-world impact.
What excites me most about grape is the opportunity to reimagine a traditional industry through user-centered design, making healthcare and insurance more accessible and intuitive. The challenge of reducing complexity for employees, doctors, HR managers, and payroll professionals while putting employees first aligns perfectly with my core interests: decoding complexity, conducting meaningful user research, and designing solutions that genuinely improve people's lives.
I believe the competencies required for this role have been thoroughly developed in my previous positions. HR and people management is indeed the topic of one of my last projects, as my company Experis is a leading provider of HR and people management services. Across my recent experience at Telereading and previously at Siemens, I have successfully led end-to-end design initiatives in B2B SaaS environments, taking ownership of the product's full lifecycle as a dedicated Product Designer.
I have worked extensively on data-intensive platforms, particularly in the smart-building domain at Siemens in Zug, where balancing technical feasibility, strict regulatory requirements, and multi-stakeholder constraints was integral to my daily decision-making. Deconstructing ambiguity, prioritizing high-impact work, and ensuring strong alignment with product and engineering teams are now fundamental parts of my design practice.

My technical proficiency with Figma and solid understanding of accessibility principles (WCAG) enable me to create high-fidelity, responsive interfaces that meet inclusive design standards. I'm also genuinely curious about emerging technologies like AI and their potential to enhance user experiences, which aligns well with grape's forward-thinking approach.
The pace, ambition, and collaborative culture at grape demonstrate a team that is not merely building products but pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the insurance industry. The opportunity to work in a small, collaborative product team, contribute to your Design System, and directly impact user satisfaction across your platform is exactly the kind of high-growth, purpose-driven environment where I thrive.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of connecting soon and discussing how I can contribute to grape's mission.
Warm regards,
