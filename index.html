        <h1>Hi, I'm Giorgio</h1><br>

        welcome, I hope this website finds you well.<br><br>


        It's been two years and a half since I started at <strong>Siemens</strong>, and I'm still here as a <strong>User Experience Designer and Researcher</strong>, focusing on smart cities and sustainability.<br>

        I’m fascinated by complexity and how to make it easier to understand. <br>
        

        If you’d like to know more about my background, <a onclick="toggleParagraph('content1')">be my guest</a></h1>.

        <p> To download my resume, you can just <a href="CV-Giorgio_Messina.pdf" download="CV-Giorgio_Messina.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            just click here.</a><br> . Or, if you'd rather just keep reading.... <br><br>

            In a nutshell, I've worked for startups, big companies, and small companies, mostly in consultancy. I've seen a lot of different industries, contexts, and challenges. <br>
            I mainly focused on UX activities, but I’ve also been involved in business design, innovation design and workshop design and moderation.<br><br>
            
            
            I’ve used Sketch, Balsamiq, Axure RP, Microsoft and Google Suites, Mac and Windows, and so on. My main takeaway is that you can adapt any tool to achieve a specific goal if you have a clear process in place. Otherwise, the tool will essentially define the process. Right now, my usual processes revolve around Figma and some plugins, Excel/sheets and a text document, and some paper (despite my love for whiteboards).
            I think it's about finding a balance between using the tool and being used by it. I'd like to be able to reach the machine only when I know what I'm doing. Please feel free to get in touch if you'd like to know more.<br><br></p>

        I was really surprised when I found out I could build this whole thing by myself, using only an Figma file and an AI to translate my ideas into HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Would you like to know more about the process?come back next week to find the the Figma file.</a>
