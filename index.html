                <h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>
                <p>In a nutshell I've worked for startups, big companies, and small companies, mostly in consultancy. I've seen a lot of different industries, contexts, and challenges. I designed interfaces for financial services, for I mainly focused on UX activities, but I've also been involved in business design, innovation design and workshop design and moderation. For more information on projects, please feel free to contact me. A detailed portfolio and client list are available upon request.</p>

                <h3>This website</h3>
                <p>I could build this whole thing by myself, using only an Figma file and an AI to translate my ideas into HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is not a complex site, but it provides a <a href="#" id="theme-toggle">dark theme</a> as well. Unnecessary, but quite cool. This started as a personal challenge and turned out! AI is pretty solidly performing.</p>
